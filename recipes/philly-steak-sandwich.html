    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These Philly cheesesteak sandwiches are made with a delicious seasoning of herbs and spices. I purchase steak that has been sliced for making stir-fry, which takes a little less time, but achieves the same results.</p>
    <p>Total time is 40 mins (15 mins prep; 25 mins cook time) and yields 4 sandwiches.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>½ teaspoon salt</ul>
    <ul>½ teaspoon black pepper</ul>
    <ul>½ teaspoon paprika</ul>
    <ul>½ teaspoon chili powder</ul>
    <ul>½ teaspoon onion powder</ul>
    <ul>½ teaspoon garlic powder</ul>
    <ul>½ teaspoon dried thyme</ul>
    <ul>½ teaspoon dried marjoram</ul>
    <ul>½ teaspoon dried basil</ul>
    <ul>1 pound beef sirloin, cut into thin 2 inch strips</ul>
    <ul>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</ul>
    <ul>1 onion, sliced</ul>
    <ul>1 green bell pepper, julienned</ul>
    <ul>3 ounces Swiss cheese, thinly sliced</ul>
    <ul>4 hoagie rolls, split lengthwise</ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together salt, pepper, paprika, chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder, thyme, marjoram, and basil in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Place beef in a large bowl. Sprinkle seasoning mixture over top and stir to coat.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/2 of the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and saute to the desired doneness. Remove to a plate.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining oil in the skillet. Add onion and green pepper and saute until tender.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven on the broiler setting.</li>
        <li>Divide cooked beef between the bottoms of 4 rolls. Layer with onion and green pepper, then top with sliced cheese. Place on a cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Broil in the preheated oven until cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Cover with tops of rolls and serve.</li>
        </ol>
